🏠 Home Loan Solutions by Ex-SBI Officer
💡 About the Website

Home Loan Solutions is a professional, user-friendly informational website built to guide individuals through the complex process of obtaining home loans in India, particularly focusing on the Delhi-NCR region.
The website was inspired by the real-world expertise of a retired State Bank of India officer, who now dedicates his experience to helping people understand home loan procedures, eligibility, documentation, and government benefits — all at no consultation charge.

The platform offers:

A clean and accessible interface for all age groups.

A built-in EMI Calculator for accurate financial planning.

A WhatsApp-based consultation form for instant communication.

A Knowledge Hub and Authentic References section linking users to verified government and banking resources.
